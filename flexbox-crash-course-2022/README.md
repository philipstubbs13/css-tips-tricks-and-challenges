* The Flexible Box Model is a one dimensional layout model that provides a method to offer space distribution and powerful alignment capabilities.
    * Before Flexbox, we aligned elements using floats and tables. Flexbox has made life much easier for people that use CSS.
    * CSS Grid is another option for alignment, positioning, etc. It's good to learn both.
* The flex container is the element that holds flex items. Flex items are direct children of flex containers. A container is created with `display: flex`.
